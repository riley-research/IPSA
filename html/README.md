The **I**&#8203;nteractive **P**&#8203;eptide **S**&#8203;pectrum **A**&#8203;nnotator, or IPSA for short, is a web-based utility for the annotation of shotgun proteomics mass spectrometry data. IPSA generates interactive visualizations from peptide spectra collected from standard bottom-up proteomic workflows. These visualizations can be exported in SVG format to be used in figure generation or to be shared with collaborators. Additionally, annotated fragment ions and additional metrics can be exported in CSV format for instrument performance evaluation.

IPSA can be accessed by navigating to http://www.interactivepeptidespectralannotator.com

The wiki links below contain instructions on how to use IPSA to:
* [Annotate individual peptide spectra](https://github.com/coongroup/IPSA/wiki/Single-Spectrum-Annotation)
* [Upload multiple peptide identifications and spectra](https://github.com/coongroup/IPSA/wiki/Data-Upload)
* [Analyze previously uploaded identifications](https://github.com/coongroup/IPSA/wiki/Analyze-Uploaded-Identifications)
----
* [Local install using Docker](https://github.com/coongroup/IPSA/wiki/Docker)
* [Local server implementation](https://github.com/coongroup/IPSA/wiki/Private-Hosting)
* [IPSA directive](https://github.com/coongroup/IPSA/wiki/IPSA-Directive)
